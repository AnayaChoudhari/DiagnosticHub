## DiagnosticHub

DiagnosticHub is an advanced disease prediction system designed to predict the likelihood of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, and breast cancer. This project aims to enhance diagnostic accuracy, offering a reliable tool for early detection of critical health conditions.

### Features

- **Multi-Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of developing heart disease, diabetes, liver disease, kidney disease, and breast cancer using advanced machine learning models.
- **Real-time Health Risk Assessment:** Provides immediate feedback on disease risk, offering users valuable insights for early intervention and health management.
- **Prediction Across Multiple Organs:** Predicts the likelihood of diseases affecting various organs, including the heart, liver, kidney, and pancreas, enabling comprehensive health assessments.

### Tech Stack

- **HTML & CSS:** For the frontend design and structure.
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend framework for responsive UI.
- **Python:** Backend development and disease prediction model.
  
#### Libraries

- **scikit-learn:** Used for the Random Forest model and machine learning tasks.
- **Pandas:** Data handling and manipulation.
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations and array handling.
- **Joblib:** Used to save and load the trained models.
